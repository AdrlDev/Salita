    <string name="fsl_overview_desc">According to projections made by the Philippine Statistics Authority there are 1,784,690 people who have hearing impairments in 2020. They are a part of various communities across the nation and are primarily children of hearing families who teach them how to use home signs. Through formal FSL instruction in elementary school, deaf children can communicate with hearing people as well as with other deaf people. It is not surprising that negative attitudes toward deafness are so common. Children who are deaf are frequently forced to adapt to a hearing environment (Balanquit, 2023).</string>
